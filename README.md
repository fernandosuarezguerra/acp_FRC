Automatic  calibration procedure for FRC parameters using OOFEM an SciPy

This repository gathers the main code and some examples of usage of an automatic calibration procedure developed in Python that, by using finite element models created with OOFEM and using optimization tools available in Scipy, allows calibrating automatically 6 parameters that define the material behavior of Fibre-Reinforced-Concrete specimens under a three-point bending test on notched specimens.
